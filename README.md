### Gotchas on learning
- Following the tutorial, I ended up manually changing the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` headers to allow access origin
- There's an `OPTION` method request  that was called before hitting the `DELETE` method  request. I'm still unsure why.
